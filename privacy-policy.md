1. **Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 13.

1. **International Data Transfers**

We comply with applicable laws when transferring personal information internationally.

By using our services, you consent to your information being transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries where we and our third-party service providers operate.

1. **Data Protection Assessments**

In compliance with applicable privacy laws, including the CTDPA, we conduct regular data protection assessments for processing activities that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers. These assessments evaluate the risks associated with the processing activities, implement measures to mitigate such risks, and are reviewed and updated periodically to ensure continued effectiveness. We maintain documentation of these assessments as required by law and may share relevant portions with regulatory authorities upon valid request.

1. **UCPA-Specific Provisions**
    1. Correction Right: While the UCPA does not provide consumers with a right to correct inaccurate personal information, we offer this right to all users as a matter of good practice. We reserve the right to deny correction requests that are unreasonable, excessive, fraudulent, or would require disproportionate technical effort.
    2. Profiling: Under the UCPA, you have the right to opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. However, this right does not apply to profiling necessary for service functionality, fraud prevention, security purposes, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law. To exercise this right, please contact us at [privacy@94talent.com](mailto:privacy@94talent.com).
2. **Updates to This Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of any material changes via email through a prominent notice on our website at least 30 days before the changes take effect. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised when changes are made. Your continued use of our services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the changes, you must discontinue use of our services.

## App Overview

The App provides AI-powered recording and note-taking tools for meetings and conversations. It offers features for Users to record audio, generate transcriptions, create meeting summaries, and access key highlights without the need for third-party meeting participants or bots. The App includes functionality for Users to download recordings and transcripts, and search through past meetings. This is a lightly updated version of your current overview.

The App also provides an **Evaluation Copilot**, which may include scorecards, evaluation summaries, evaluation template generation, and a chatbot to interact with transcript, evaluation, and meeting summary data.

## Third-Party AI Providers

The App uses third-party service providers to deliver certain AI features, including **AssemblyAI for transcription** and **OpenAI** for certain natural language processing features such as summaries, evaluation assistance, and chatbot responses.

## Account Creation and Management

Users may create an account to use the App and must provide accurate, current, and complete information. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials and for all activities that occur under their account. This responsibility includes recordings, transcriptions, meeting summaries, and evaluation outputs generated through their account. This follows your existing account responsibility framework.

**Candidate and Employer Accounts.**\
94Talent may offer separate account experiences for employers and candidates. **Candidate account data is not visible to employers by default** unless a candidate chooses to share specific information or the product enables authorized sharing.

---

## Recording Consent and Compliance

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of the App complies with all applicable data protection, privacy, and recording laws. Users represent and warrant that they obtain clear, informed consent from all individuals before recording, transcribing, storing, or sharing any conversation or meeting using the App, where required by law; and that they will comply with organizational retention, deletion, and security policies. This maintains your current compliance posture.

This includes compliance obligations related to recording, storing, or sharing **candidate data** or evaluation information.

If a User is subject to special industry regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, FINRA), they acknowledge the Company is not a regulated entity and the App does not provide compliance with such laws unless independently ensured by the User.

## Plans and Pricing

The App may be available with a free plan and may offer paid plans. Additional plan and pricing information may be listed on the App and/or Company website. This remains consistent with your existing section.

---

## Intellectual Property

Company retains all right, title, and interest in and to the App and its AI technology. Users retain ownership of their original content and grant Company a license to process, use, store, and analyze such content as necessary for the App’s functionality. All transcriptions, summaries, highlights, and other AI-generated outputs are the intellectual property of Company, consistent with your existing IP approach.

## Warranties and Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

**AI-Generated Content Disclaimer.**\
Company expressly disclaims responsibility for the accuracy of transcriptions, summaries, evaluation outputs, or other AI-generated content. The App is an assistive tool only. Users acknowledge that AI outputs may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies and that Users are solely responsible for reviewing and verifying AI-generated content before relying on it. This section is intentionally preserved in substance because it strongly supports your new “AI reasonings require human verification” requirement.

**Evaluation Reasonings.**\
AI-generated evaluation reasonings may be displayed to support or reflect user-provided score ratings, voice notes, or text notes based on transcript data. **Users remain responsible for validating these reasonings and for all final evaluation decisions.**

**Third-Party AI Disclaimer.**\
The App may incorporate third-party AI models or external integrations not owned or controlled by Company. Company makes no warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, legality, security, or compliance of third-party AI outputs. Users acknowledge reliance is at their own risk. This is consistent with your existing disclaimer structure.

## Termination, Privacy Policy, and Other Standard Terms

Your existing sections on termination, links to third-party sites, electronic communications, limitation of liability, indemnification, arbitration, severability, and entire agreement can remain materially the same with brand and product-name updates.

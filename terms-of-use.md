## App Overview

The App provides AI-powered recording and note-taking tools for meetings and conversations. It enables Users to record audio, generate AI transcriptions, create meeting summaries, and access key highlights without the need for third-party meeting participants or bots.

The App also provides an Evaluation Copilot, which may include scorecards, evaluation summaries, evaluation template generation, and a chatbot that helps Users interact with transcript, evaluation, and meeting summary data.

The App includes functionality for Users to download recordings and transcripts, and search through past meetings and evaluation materials.

**Third-Party Transcription**\
The App uses a third-party transcription provider, including AssemblyAI, to generate AI transcripts and related speech analysis. When transcription is enabled, audio may be transmitted to and processed by this provider on our behalf.

## Third-Party AI Providers

The App uses third-party service providers to deliver certain AI features, including **AssemblyAI for transcription** and **OpenAI** for certain natural language processing features such as summaries, evaluation assistance, and chatbot responses.

## Account Creation and Management

Users may create an account to use the App. All Users must be at least 18 years old to create and manage their own account. Users must provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and keep this information updated. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials and for all activities that occur under their account, even if such activities are not authorized by the account holder. This responsibility includes all recordings, transcriptions, and meeting summaries generated through their account. Users must immediately notify Company of any unauthorized use or security breach. Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts at its sole discretion. Users are prohibited from transferring their accounts to any other person or entity.

**Candidate and Employer Accounts.**\
94Talent may offer separate account experiences for employers and candidates. **Candidate account data is not visible to employers by default** unless a candidate chooses to share specific information or the product enables authorized sharing.

## Recording Consent and Compliance

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of the App complies with all applicable data protection, privacy, and recording laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and all applicable state, federal, and international privacy regulations. By using the App, Users represent and warrant that they: (i) Obtain clear, informed consent from all individuals before recording, transcribing, storing, or sharing any conversation or meeting using the App, where required by law; (ii) Understand that recording without proper consent may be illegal, and it is solely the user’s responsibility to comply with all applicable recording and privacy laws; (iii) Will not collect, store, or share sensitive personal data, such as financial information, government IDs, health records, or children’s data, in violation of applicable laws; (iv) Acknowledge that the Company does not monitor, verify, or control the content Users record or process and bears no liability for any claims arising from unauthorized or unlawful data collection; (v) Are responsible for ensuring their compliance with their organization’s data retention, deletion, and security policies; and (vi) Will indemnify, defend, and hold the Company harmless from any claims, fines, or penalties resulting from a User’s failure to comply with data protection laws or obtain proper consent.

Users must not use the App to process regulated data unless they independently ensure full compliance. In the event of a suspected data breach affecting personal data collected through the App, the Company will notify Users as required by applicable law. However, Users acknowledge that no system is entirely secure, and the Company is not liable for unauthorized access, data loss, or third-party breaches except as required by law.

If User fails to make timely payment for a paid plan, access may be suspended or terminated until payment is received. Additionally, Company reserves the right to terminate if third-party service providers discontinue or restrict services critical to the App’s functionality. If Company terminates a paid User’s access without good cause, User will receive a pro rata refund for the unused portion of the subscription. Users may terminate their account at any time by following the designated account settings process. Deleting the App does not automatically terminate these Terms, and Users remain responsible for any unpaid fees. Upon termination, all rights granted to the User immediately cease, and Company may delete all User data, including recordings and transcriptions, except where retention is required by law. Sections intended to survive termination shall survive.
